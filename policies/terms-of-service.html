        <p>By agreeing to these Terms of Service, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your state
            or province of residence, and you have given us your consent to allow any of your minor dependents to use
            the Services on devices you own, purchase or manage.</p>
        <p>To use the Services, including accessing or browsing our online stores or purchasing any of the products or
            services we offer, you may be asked to provide certain information, such as your email address, billing,
            payment, and shipping information. You represent and warrant that all the information you provide in our
            stores is correct, current and complete and that you have all rights necessary to provide this information.
        </p>
        <p>You are solely responsible for maintaining the security of your account credentials and for all of your
            account activity. You may not transfer, sell, assign, or license your account to any other person.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 2 - OUR PRODUCTS</h2>
        <p>We have made every effort to provide an accurate representation of our products and services in our online
            stores. However, please note that colors or product appearance may differ from how they may appear on your
            screen due to the type of device you use to access the store and your device settings and configuration.</p>
        <p>We do not warrant that the appearance or quality of any products or services purchased by you will meet your
            expectations or be the same as depicted or rendered in our online stores.</p>
        <p>All descriptions of products are subject to change at any time without notice at our sole discretion. We
            reserve the right to discontinue any product at any time and may limit the quantities of any products that
            we offer to any person, geographic region or jurisdiction, on a case-by-case basis.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 3 - ORDERS</h2>
        <p>When you place an order, you are making an offer to purchase. Blom Fit reserves the right to accept or
            decline your order for any reason at its discretion. Your order is not accepted until Blom Fit confirms
            acceptance. We must receive and process your payment before your order is accepted. Please review your order
            carefully before submitting, as Blom Fit may be unable to accommodate cancellation requests after an order
            is accepted. In the event that we do not accept, make a change to, or cancel an order, we will attempt to
            notify you by contacting the e‑mail, billing address, and/or phone number provided at the time the order was
            made.</p>
        <p>Your purchases are subject to return or exchange solely in accordance with our Refund Policy.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that your purchases are for your own personal or household use and not for
            commercial resale or export.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 4 - PRICES AND BILLING</h2>
        <p>Prices, discounts and promotions are subject to change without notice. The price charged for a product or
            service will be the price in effect at the time the order is placed and will be set out in your order
            confirmation email. Unless otherwise expressly stated, posted prices do not include taxes, shipping,
            handling, customs or import charges.</p>
        <p>Prices posted in our online stores may be different from prices offered in physical stores or in online or
            other stores operated by third parties. We may offer, from time to time, promotions on the Services that may
            affect pricing and that are governed by terms and conditions separate from these Terms. If there is a
            conflict between the terms for a promotion and these Terms, the promotion terms will govern.</p>
        <p>You agree to provide current, complete and accurate purchase, payment and account information for all
            purchases made at our stores. You agree to promptly update your account and other information, including
            your email address, credit card numbers and expiration dates, so that we can complete your transactions and
            contact you as needed.</p>
        <p>You represent and warrant that (i) the credit card information you provide is true, correct, and complete,
            (ii) you are duly authorized to use such credit card for the purchase, (iii) charges incurred by you will be
            honored by your credit card company, and (iv) you will pay charges incurred by you at the posted prices,
            including shipping and handling charges and all applicable taxes, if any.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 5 - SHIPPING AND DELIVERY</h2>
        <p>We are not liable for shipping and delivery delays. All delivery times are estimates only and are not
            guaranteed. We are not responsible for delays caused by shipping carriers, customs processing, or events
            outside our control. Once we transfer products to the carrier, title and risk of loss passes to you.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 6 - INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</h2>
        <p>Our Services, including but not limited to all trademarks, brands, text, displays, images, graphics, product
            reviews, video, and audio, and the design, selection, and arrangement thereof, are owned by Blom Fit, its
            affiliates or licensors and are protected by U.S. and foreign patent, copyright and other intellectual
            property laws.</p>
        <p>These Terms permit you to use the Services for your personal, non-commercial use only. You must not
            reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, republish,
            download, store, or transmit any of the material on the Services without our prior written consent. Except
            as expressly provided herein, nothing in these Terms grants or shall be construed as granting a license or
            other rights to you under any patent, trademark, copyright, or other intellectual property of Blom Fit,
            Shopify or any third party. Unauthorized use of the Services may be a violation of federal and state
            intellectual property laws. All rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by Blom Fit.</p>
        <p>Blom Fit’s names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans are trademarks of Blom Fit or its
            affiliates or licensors. You must not use such trademarks without the prior written permission of Blom Fit.
            Shopify’s name, logo, product and service names, designs and slogans are trademarks of Shopify. All other
            names, logos, product and service names, designs, and slogans on the Services are the trademarks of their
            respective owners.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 7 - OPTIONAL TOOLS</h2>
        <p>You may be provided with access to customer tools offered by third parties as part of the Services, which we
            neither monitor nor have any control nor input.</p>
        <p>You acknowledge and agree that we provide access to such tools “as is” and “as available” without any
            warranties, representations or conditions of any kind and without any endorsement. We shall have no
            liability whatsoever arising from or relating to your use of optional third-party tools.</p>
        <p>Any use by you of the optional tools offered through the site is entirely at your own risk and discretion and
            you should ensure that you are familiar with and approve of the terms on which tools are provided by the
            relevant third-party provider(s).</p>
        <p>We may also, in the future, offer new features through the Services (including the release of new tools and
            resources). Such new features shall also be deemed part of the Services and are subject to these Terms of
            Service.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 8 - THIRD-PARTY LINKS</h2>
        <p>The Services may contain materials and hyperlinks to websites provided or operated by third parties
            (including any embedded third party functionality). We are not responsible for examining or evaluating the
            content or accuracy of any third-party materials or websites you choose to access. If you decide to leave
            the Services to access these materials or third party sites, you do so at your own risk.</p>
        <p>We are not liable for any harm or damages related to your access of any third-party websites, or your
            purchase or use of any products, services, resources, or content on any third-party websites. Please review
            carefully the third-party's policies and practices and make sure you understand them before you engage in
            any transaction. Complaints, claims, concerns, or questions regarding third-party products and services
            should be directed to the third-party.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 9 - RELATIONSHIP WITH SHOPIFY</h2>
        <p>Blom Fit is powered by Shopify, which enables us to provide the Services to you. However, any sales and
            purchases you make in our Store are made directly with Blom Fit. By using the Services, you acknowledge and
            agree that Shopify is not responsible for any aspect of any sales between you and Blom Fit, including any
            injury, damage, or loss resulting from purchased products and services. You hereby expressly release Shopify
            and its affiliates from all claims, damages, and liabilities arising from or related to your purchases and
            transactions with Blom Fit.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 10 - PRIVACY POLICY</h2>
        <p>All personal information we collect through the Services is subject to our Privacy Policy, and certain
            personal information may be subject to Shopify’s Privacy Policy, which can be viewed here. By using the
            Services, you acknowledge that you have read these privacy policies.</p>
        <p>Because the Services are hosted by Shopify, Shopify collects and processes personal information about your
            access to and use of the Services in order to provide and improve the Services for you. Information you
            submit to the Services will be transmitted to and shared with Shopify as well as third parties that may be
            located in other countries than where you reside, in order to provide services to you. Review our privacy
            policy for more details on how we, Shopify, and our partners use your personal information.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 11 - FEEDBACK</h2>
        <p>If you submit, upload, post, email, or otherwise transmit any ideas, suggestions, feedback, reviews,
            proposals, plans, or other content (collectively, “Feedback”), you grant us a perpetual, worldwide,
            sublicensable, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, publish, distribute and display such Feedback
            in any medium for any purpose, including for commercial use. We may, for example, use our rights under this
            license to operate, provide, evaluate, enhance, improve and promote the Services and to perform our
            obligations and exercise our rights under the Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>You also represent and warrant that: (i) you own or have all necessary rights to all Feedback; (ii) you have
            disclosed any compensation or incentives received in connection with your submission of Feedback; and (iii)
            your Feedback will comply with these Terms. We are and shall be under no obligation (1) to maintain your
            Feedback in confidence; (2) to pay compensation for your Feedback; or (3) to respond to your Feedback.</p>
        <p>We may, but have no obligation to, monitor, edit or remove Feedback that we determine in our sole discretion
            to be unlawful, offensive, threatening, libelous, defamatory, pornographic, obscene or otherwise
            objectionable or violates any party’s intellectual property or these Terms of Service.</p>
        <p>You agree that your Feedback will not violate any right of any third-party, including copyright, trademark,
            privacy, personality or other personal or proprietary right. You further agree that your Feedback will not
            contain libelous or otherwise unlawful, abusive or obscene Feedback, or contain any computer virus or other
            malware that could in any way affect the operation of the Services or any related website. You may not use a
            false email address, pretend to be someone other than yourself, or otherwise mislead us or third-parties as
            to the origin of any Feedback. You are solely responsible for any Feedback you make and its accuracy. We
            take no responsibility and assume no liability for any Feedback posted by you or any third-party.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 12 - ERRORS, INACCURACIES AND OMISSIONS</h2>
        <p>Occasionally there may be information on or in the Services that contain typographical errors, inaccuracies
            or omissions that may relate to product descriptions, pricing, promotions, offers, product shipping charges,
            transit times and availability. We reserve the right to correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions, and
            to change or update information or cancel orders if any information is inaccurate at any time without prior
            notice (including after you have submitted your order).</p>

        <h2>SECTION 13 - PROHIBITED USES</h2>
        <p>You may access and use the Services for lawful purposes only. You may not access or use the Services,
            directly or indirectly: (a) for any unlawful or malicious purpose; (b) to violate any international,
            federal, provincial or state regulations, rules, laws, or local ordinances; (c) to infringe upon or violate
            our intellectual property rights or the intellectual property rights of others; (d) to harass, abuse,
            insult, harm, defame, slander, disparage, intimidate, or harm any of our employees or any other person; (e)
            to transmit false or misleading information; (f) to send, knowingly receive, upload, download, use, or
            re-use any material that does not comply with the these Terms; (g) to transmit, or procure the sending of,
            any advertising or promotional material, including any “junk mail,” “chain letter,” “spam,” or any other
            similar solicitation; (h) to impersonate or attempt to impersonate any other person or entity; or (i) to
            engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the Services, or which,
            as determined by us, may harm Blom Fit, Shopify or users of the Services, or expose them to liability.</p>
        <p>In addition, you agree not to: (a) upload or transmit viruses or any other type of malicious code that will
            or may be used in any way that will affect the functionality or operation of the Services; (b) reproduce,
            duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services; (c) collect or track the personal

            determine that you have violated any part of these Terms.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 14 - TERMINATION</h2>
        <p>We may terminate this agreement or your access to the Services (or any part thereof) in our sole discretion
            at any time without notice, and you will remain liable for all amounts due up to and including the date of
            termination.</p>
        <p>The following sections will continue to apply following any termination: Intellectual Property, Feedback,
            Termination, Disclaimer of Warranties, Limitation of Liability, Indemnification, Severability, Waiver;
            Entire Agreement, Assignment, Governing Law, Privacy Policy, and any other provisions that by their nature
            should survive termination.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 15 - DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h2>
        <p>The information presented on or through the Services is made available solely for general information
            purposes. We do not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of this information. Any reliance you
            place on such information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising
            from any reliance placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Services, or by anyone who may
            be informed of any of its contents.</p>
        <p>EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY STATED BY Blom Fit, THE SERVICES AND ALL PRODUCTS OFFERED THROUGH THE SERVICES ARE
            PROVIDED 'AS IS' AND 'AS AVAILABLE' FOR YOUR USE, WITHOUT ANY REPRESENTATION, WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF
            ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY,
            MERCHANTABLE QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, DURABILITY, TITLE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. WE DO NOT
            GUARANTEE, REPRESENT OR WARRANT THAT YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED, TIMELY, SECURE OR
            ERROR-FREE. SOME JURISDICTIONS LIMIT OR DO NOT ALLOW THE DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED OR OTHER WARRANTIES SO THE
            ABOVE DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 16 - LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
        <p>TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PROVIDED BY LAW, IN NO CASE SHALL Blom Fit, OUR PARTNERS, DIRECTORS, OFFICERS,
            EMPLOYEES, AFFILIATES, AGENTS, CONTRACTORS, SERVICE PROVIDERS OR LICENSORS, OR THOSE OF SHOPIFY AND ITS
            AFFILIATES, BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY, LOSS, CLAIM, OR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, SPECIAL,
            OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOST PROFITS, LOST REVENUE, LOST
            SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, REPLACEMENT COSTS, OR ANY SIMILAR DAMAGES, WHETHER BASED IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
            NEGLIGENCE), STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE SERVICES OR ANY PRODUCTS
            PROCURED USING THE SERVICES, OR FOR ANY OTHER CLAIM RELATED IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY
            PRODUCT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY ERRORS OR OMISSIONS IN ANY CONTENT, OR ANY LOSS OR DAMAGE OF ANY
            KIND INCURRED AS A RESULT OF THE USE OF THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT (OR PRODUCT) POSTED, TRANSMITTED, OR
            OTHERWISE MADE AVAILABLE VIA THE SERVICES, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THEIR POSSIBILITY.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 17 - INDEMNIFICATION</h2>
        <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Blom Fit, Shopify, and our affiliates, partners, officers,
            directors, employees, agents, contractors, licensors, and service providers from any losses, damages,
            liabilities or claims, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, payable to any third party due to or arising
            out of (1) your breach of these Terms of Service or the documents they incorporate by reference, (2) your
            violation of any law or the rights of a third party, or (3) your access to and use of the Services.</p>
        <p>We will notify you of any indemnifiable claim, provided that a failure to promptly notify will not relieve
            you of your obligations unless you are materially prejudiced. We may control the defense and settlement of
            such claim at your expense, including choice of counsel, but will not settle any claim requiring
            non-monetary obligations from you without your consent (not to be unreasonably withheld). You will cooperate
            in the defense of indemnified claims, including by providing relevant documents.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 18 - SEVERABILITY</h2>
        <p>In the event that any provision of these Terms of Service is determined to be unlawful, void or
            unenforceable, such provision shall nonetheless be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable
            law, and the unenforceable portion shall be deemed to be severed from these Terms of Service, such
            determination shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any other remaining provisions.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 19 - WAIVER; ENTIRE AGREEMENT</h2>
        <p>The failure of us to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not
            constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
        <p>These Terms of Service and any policies or operating rules posted by us on this site or in respect to the
            Service constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between you and us and governs your use of the
            Service, superseding any prior or contemporaneous agreements, communications and proposals, whether oral or
            written, between you and us (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the Terms of Service).</p>
        <p>Any ambiguities in the interpretation of these Terms of Service shall not be construed against the drafting
            party.</p>

        <h2>SECTION 20 - ASSIGNMENT</h2>
